# Dix-repacker
PsychEngine assets to Dix engine ones.
## Why?
Dix engine is an FNF engine built on CCode. This is an app constructor for Android. It supports spritesheets and animations, but in limited form and it doesn't support XML. So the idea here is to make assets the easiest way compatible for the CCode from the Psych ones.
