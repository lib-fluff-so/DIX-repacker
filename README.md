# Dix-repacker
A Python PsychEngine assets repacker to Dix engine ones.
# Why?
Dix engine is an FNF engine built on CCode. It is an app constructor for Android. It supports spritesheets and animations, but in limited form and it doesn't support XML. So the idea here is to make assets the easiest way compatible for the CCode from the Psych ones.

# How to use
You need to copy **characters** and **images** folder from **assets/shared/** folder of PsychEngine into scripts root folder. If you already installed the script, then you are good to go! Just run the script, and it will do everything.
